I submitted a software paper to the [Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)](https://joss.org) presenting the Python code for producing the ice-marginal lake inventory series. This involved cleaning up the [GrIML code repository](https://github.com/GEUS-Glaciology-and-Climate/GrIML) and adding documentation for the Python package where clarification was needed.

I also sent off a list to the Glaciolab workshop for weather station instruments we need building and shipping to external project stations in the Nuuk area.

Finally, something fun to look forward to is glacier safety training in Iceland. I spent some time planning travel for this, to include a stop over in Copenhagen for first aid and rifle safety training also.

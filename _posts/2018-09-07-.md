<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tunabreen is a tidewater glacier in Svalbard which has been closely monitored in recent years as the glacier has undergone an 'early' so-called surge phase. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="https://pennyhow.wordpress.com/2017/03/11/what-is-going-on-at-tunabreen/">I reported on this activity previously when the surge first commenced</a></span>, and now it appears that it is coming to an end. This begs the question what happened during the surge and why did it happen now?  </strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Tunabreen is a tidewater glacier situated on the west coast of Svalbard that is special in the sense that, like a large proportion of glaciers in Svalbard, is a <strong>surge-type glacier</strong>. A surge-type glacier undergoes periods of fast-flow followed by very slow, inactive phases. This behaviour is due to the glacier's inefficiency to transfer mass to the glacier terminus (<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/igsoc/jog/2015/00000061/00000228/art00004" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sevestre and Benn, 2015</a></strong></span>). It is generally understood that <strong>this phenomena is linked to internal processes in the glacier</strong>, rather than external factors such as air temperature, ocean temperature, and precipitation.</p>

<p class="mceTemp" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-align:justify;">Tunabreen is one of few glaciers in Svalbard to have been observed to undergo repeated surge cycles - it surged in 1870, 1930, 1971, and between 2002-2005. We know these surges happened because each surge phase left a pronounced ridge on the seabed which defines the surge extent (</span><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379114004442" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flink et al., 2015</a></strong></span><span style="text-align:justify;">). As these surges have been spaced 30-60 years apart, <strong>the next surge was not expected for quite a while (at least until 2030)</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A marked change in Tunabreen's velocity was first detected in September 2016, followed by a noticeable advance of the terminus Tunabreen. <strong>Glacier flow at the terminus accelerated ten-fold</strong>, from 0.1-0.4 metres per day (m/day) to &gt;3 m/day.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So, is this a surge?</strong> is the question on everyone's lips now. In short, we don't know at the moment and this is a difficult question to answer with the short amount of time that we have witnessed these changes at Tunabreen. At the time of writing, there are <strong>4 key observations</strong> that need to be considered:</p>

<ol>
	<li style="text-align:justify;">The timing of this speed-up coincides with record-high temperatures and precipitation for a winter season in Svalbard (as stated in <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><a href="http://www.unis.no/tunabreen-may-surging-decades-earlier-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this article</a></strong></span> by Chris Borstad, a glaciologist at <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><a href="http://www.unis.no/staff/chris-borstad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNIS</a></strong></span>). This could have had a significant influence on the presence of water at the bed of the glacier, which is understood to lubricate the interface between the ice and the underlying bedrock. This, in turn, promotes sliding and may also cause the glacier to flow faster.</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify;">This winter, sea ice did not form in Tempelfjorden and the fjord area directly adjacent to the glacier front. Sea ice and melange is understood to provide a back-stress against the front of a glacier. This acts as an opposing force to ice flow. Without the presence of sea ice, this opposing force is absent at the front of Tunabreen. Lack of sea ice was also observed in the winter of 2015 (<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><a href="https://pennyhow.wordpress.com/2016/03/17/svalbard-feb-mar-2016/">as noted here</a></strong></span> in a previous blog post).</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify;">The spatial pattern of this speed-up propagated in an upward fashion i.e. an increase in velocity first occurred at the front of the glacier, with subsequent velocity changes progressing up the glacier tongue. The abundance of crevasses on the glacier surface has increased, with the crevasse field extending much further up the glacier tongue than previously. Also, the terminus has advanced roughly 400 m since December 2016, as shown from the sequence of Sentinel images <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/adrian_luckman/status/842372501409800192" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted by Adrian Luckman</a></strong></span> (and displayed in a post by <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><a href="http://standrewsglaciology.org/archives/871" target="_blank" rel="noopener">St. Andrews Glaciology</a></strong></span>). These observations are indicative of surging dynamics, as stated by <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/igsoc/jog/2015/00000061/00000228/art00004" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sevestre and Benn (2015)</a></strong></span>.</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify;">This speed-up has occurred 12 years after the previous surge (2002-2005). Surges at Tunabreen have previously been spaced 30-60 years apart from one another. The next surge was not expected until at least 2030. If this speed-up is associated with surge dynamics then it has occurred much earlier than anticipated.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These observations can be used as arguments for and against this speed-up being associated with surge dynamics. <strong>Whilst the behaviour of the glacier indicates that this may be associated with surge dynamics, there have also been significant changes in external factors which could have played a crucial role in this speed-up.</strong> It is important to continue monitoring changes to better understand the processes behind the abnormal behaviour at Tunabreen. It will be interesting to see if this speed-up is sustained through the spring of 2017, and to see how much the terminus will continue to advance into Tempelfjorden. One thing is for certain: all eyes will be on Tunabreen and what it does next!</p>

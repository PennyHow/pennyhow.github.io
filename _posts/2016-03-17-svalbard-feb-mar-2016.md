<h4 style="text-align:justify;">For the past month I have been in Svalbard, demonstrating on the Glaciology course (AG-325/825) at the University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS). The course is aimed at Masters and PhD students who want a taste of the Arctic, consisting of four weeks of glaciology lectures  and weekly excursions to glaciers in the local area. I have been supporting the logistical side of the weekly excursions, with the odd bit of teaching here and there. The course ran very successfully and everyone seemed to thoroughly enjoy themselves. Here are a few photos from the course...</h4>

I am often at the back of the student group on these excursions, making sure that the group is okay. I find it very relaxing being at the back as I can happily stop and take pictures like this! [/caption]

The students were especially enthusiastic to get up close and personal to the glacier front! As you can probably tell, I am a very (very very very) amateur photographer. For much better photos taken in Svalbard, I would definitely recommend checking out <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/cerberus001/" target="_blank">Frede Lamo</a></span></strong> who, as well as working in the logistics department at UNIS, is a professional photographer and very (very very very) good at taking photos of Svalbard wildlife and scenery.[/caption]

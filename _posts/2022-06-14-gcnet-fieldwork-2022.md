<p style="text-align:justify;">In May 2022, a team went to NE Greenland to install new automatic weather stations (AWS) and perform AWS maintanence at four existing sites. Two of these are referred to <b>NASA-E</b> and <b>TUNU</b>, which are located in the interior part of the ice sheet and associated with the <a href="http://cires1.colorado.edu/steffen/gcnet/">Greenland Climate Network (GC-Net)</a>. The other two are known as <b>KPC-U</b> (upper) and <b>KPC-L</b> (lower), which are located at the ice sheet periphery and part of the <a href="https://promice.dk/">Programme for Monitoring of the Greenland Ice Sheet (PROMICE)</a>. The locations of these stations can be viewed <a href="https://promice.org/weather-stations/">here</a>. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The AWS stations were visited using a Twin Otter plane, flying to them from Mestersvig and Danmarkshavn. </p>


## NASA-E

The weather was a little breezy, so a shelter was put up to shield those working on the station from the cold wind*

Although it is not transmitting anymore, it is still recording data which was collected during this trip*

As it was the first station visit of the trip, we took a long time at this site - 8 hours in total* 


## TUNU

A team from the US had set up a drilling camp within the visible distance. They came over in their 4x4s to say hello*

We spent 5 hours at TUNU - much quicker than our 8-hour stint the day before* 


## KPC-U and KPC-L

On this day, we knew that we had to install two PROMICE stations in one day (at KPC_U and KPC_L), so it was tight timing* 

<img src="https://github.com/PennyHow/pennyhow.github.io/blob/master/assets/images/gc-net-2022-kpc-u-02.JPG?raw=true" alt="The new PROMICE station at KPC_U" width="800" align="aligncenter" /><br> *The new PROMICE station at KPC_U. A GNSS antenna is set up to log the position of the station for validation purposes, and provides us with an excellent opportunity for a breather (and a photo). This is why the GNSS antenna can be been seen in most of these photos* 

<img src="https://github.com/PennyHow/pennyhow.github.io/blob/master/assets/images/gc-net-2022-kpc-l-01.JPG?raw=true" alt="The new PROMICE station at KPC_L" width="800" align="aligncenter" /><br> *Very few photos were taken at KPC_L due to time constraints, which was not helped by a tricky landing with the Twin Otter. Crevasses were spotted around the current KPC_L location, so the new PROMICE station had to be set-up further away than expected (roughly 700 m)*

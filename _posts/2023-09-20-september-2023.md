<p style="text-align:justify;">Let's try and document my work again, now with a fresh start back to work after some leave. The month started straight into fieldwork, with scheduled weather station maintenance at two of our PROMICE sites near Nuuk, NUK-U and NUK-L. These two stations are the upper and lower stations on Qamanaarsuup Sermia, a glacier located at the bottom of Nuup Kangerlua (Nuuk Fjord).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">What was meant to be two fieldwork days stretched into three weeks on standby due to bad weather. But finally we got a full field day, where both stations could be maintained. The upper station's logger box had some wiring problems, which meant the box was replaced; whilst the lower station was found in a precarious position in the ablation area, perched on a serrac and leaning towards a shallow crevasse. We hope that next year the lower station can be moved upglacier and upgraded to our most recent station version.</p>

Between two station visits in August and September, the site has had a lot of snow. Our September visit was pretty chilly also!*

<p style="text-align:justify;">Whilst I was on leave, our software paper for pypromice was reviewed and accepted into Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS). With a totally transparent and open review through Github, it made for a refreshing and enjoyable review process which I highly recommend for anyone wanting to publish code. Since then, I have been asked by JOSS to review a new ice sheet model programmed in Julia, so have also been enjoying this review process from the other side now.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I've also restarted my ESA Living Planet Fellowship work, looking at mapping and monitoring ice-marginal lakes around Greenland. It was a bit daunting picking up a project after a year of dormancy, but fresh eyes on it have meant I have new ideas and approaches. The goal by the end of year is to recreate the existing ESA CCI ice-marginal lake under a unifying and efficient workflow, which I can then apply to other time periods in the next phase of the project.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">This month <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83509-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we published findings from our work on Greenland's ice marginal lakes</a></span></strong>. This work are part of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://climate.esa.int/en/projects/glaciers/" target="_blank"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">ESA Glaciers CCI (Climate Change Initiative)</span></strong></a>, focused on producing a Greenland-wide inventory of ice marginal lakes as a benchmark dataset; also referred to as an Essential Climate Variable. The publication is the culmination of a lot of dedicated work from individuals in the project, pooling together specialist knowledge on classifying ice marginal lakes through various remote sensing approaches.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">Ice marginal lakes form at the terrestrial margins of the Greenland Ice Sheet, ice caps, and mountain glaciers, where the outflow is dammed or restricted.<strong> Ice marginal lakes can buffer the contribution of glacial melt to the sea level budget</strong>, forming a significant store of meltwater. These lakes are also understood to burst due to dam failure and breaching, causing catastropic releases of water to the ocean known as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.antarcticglaciers.org/glacier-processes/glacial-lakes/glacial-lake-outburst-floods/" target="_blank"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">GLOFs (Glacial Lake Outburst Floods)</span></strong></a>. <strong>Ice marginal lake dynamics are generally ignored in current predictions of future sea level rise,</strong> where glacial runoff assumed to contribute directly to sea level once it leaves the glacial system. </p>

Kangaarssuup Tasersua is one of the largest ice-marginal lakes of the south-west region of the ice sheet margin, as mapped subsequently ('KT' in Figure 2 from How et al., 2021). Melt runoff from the outlet glacier to the east drains into the basin, but outflow is damed by the glacier in the west; forming the ice marginal lake.

<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>The inventory revealed 3347 ice marginal lakes</strong> (above 0.05 km<sup>2</sup>) across Greenland in 2017, with the highest number of lakes adjacent to the southwest ice sheet margin and Greenland's ice caps and mountain glaciers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">Comparison to previous work by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2014.02.009" target="_blank"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Carrivick and Quincey (2014)</span></strong></a> suggests a <strong>75% increase in the number of lakes along the west margin of the ice sheet over the past three decades</strong>. This trend is largely related to marked variations in the presence of smaller lakes (i.e. 0.05-0.15 km<sup>2</sup>), with future lake formation likely to be concentrated in regions where the terrestrial ice margin length will increase (e.g. where marine-terminating outlets retreat onto land).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">By evaluating the performance of the three methodologies used to derived the inventory, we uncovered that <strong>detecting ice marginal lakes is especially challenging in Greenland given its large latitudinal range</strong>. Water classification studies relying on a single detection method over large regions could be at risk to under-representation. </p>

Inderhytten is the second largest lake in our ice marginal lake inventory, at 112 km<sup>2</sup>. This was a particuarly interesting lake as its classification from satellite imagery is somewhat tricky - it is ice-covered throughout the majority of the year and its near-fjord margin lies at a low elevation.

<p class="has-text-align-justify">As we were writing the paper, a really nice complementary study came out by <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-020-0855-4" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Shugar et al., (2020)</span></a></strong> presenting a new global glacial lake inventory that included Greenland. This global inventory was derived solely from optical satellite imagery, which we found only captured 44% of the lakes present in our Greenland inventory. This reflects how <strong>multi-sensor and multi-method classification are time-consuming and require powerful processing capabilities that are not feasible in global studies at present</strong>; highlighting the need to continue this research and incorporate new and innovative approaches to classifying ice marginal lakes.</p>

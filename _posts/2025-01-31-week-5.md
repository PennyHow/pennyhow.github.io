This week we have been reviewing and setting priorities for [pypromice](https://github.com/GEUS-Glaciology-and-Climate/pypromice) and the operational processing of data from the [PROMICE and GC-Net automatic weather station network](https://promice.org). Lots of tasks have been outlined, and by the end of the week we had started to delve into the bigger re-structuring plan needed to better complete smaller, more trivial tasks. We have been using Jira to outline tasks and set priorities, beginning with our sprint. Within this sprint, I compiled documentation of the processing routines for a publication update that summarises the PROMICE/GC-Net dataset. 

On the side of this, I have been looking into how to further the ice-marginal lake inventory series and construct some interesting analysis that could form a scientific publication. So far I have been investigating marrying different datasets with the inventory series to explore extending it with GLOF (Glacial Lake Outburst Flood) information, and to explore the impact of ice-marginal lake presence on ice discharge and mass balance around the Greenland Ice Sheet. It is slow progress alongside the PROMICE/GC-Net tasks, but provides an enjoyable break to look forward to.

I didn't work in week 1 as I was still on holiday. Work days and times in week 2 were a bit all over the place this week as my daughter's daycare building is out of action at the moment. She has been attending an alternative place for now, but it is very overwhelming and she can only do half days... therefore I can only do half days of work also.

Switched out radiometer cables and replaced wind sensor on NUK_P test weather station. This happened because an update on my computer took ages, so I had time to do non-computer related tasks

Finished ESSD paper draft based on co-author comments over Christmas. Finalised and sent it out for final comments from authors. Moved Google Docs draft to Overleaf for formatting in LaTeX for submission.

Resolved discrepancy between mine and DOP's lake surface temperatures. Turns out we were using slightly different point locations for extracting temperatures. The amendments make the correlation between in situ temperatures and remote sensing estimates a much tighter correlation.

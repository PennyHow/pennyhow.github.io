Ptarmigans have been known to nest by these cameras. One particular camera is their favourite! This camera was set up on a rocky outcrop called Garwoodtoppen to measure velocities over Kronebreen glacier.*

Their feathers are normally white in colour over the winter and spring, but change to grey/brown in the summer. Over the course of a season (May - September), we capture roughly 20 ptarmigans in our images (out of a possible 6000 images).*Â

When they are in front of the camera, they block a significant patch of the glacier that we are monitoring. Silly ptarmigans!*

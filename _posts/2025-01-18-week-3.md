Life is overtaking work at the moment due to childcare complications. However, I did manage to submit the ESSD data description paper for the Greenland ice-marginal lake inventory series alongside the dataset release on GEUS Dataverse at [https://doi.org/10.22008/FK2/MBKW9N](https://doi.org/10.22008/FK2/MBKW9N). I then could submit the final ESA report for the GrIML project, including the dataset and paper submission.

On Saturday, we had the 2024 Nuuk Culture Night where many institutions open their doors to the general public for outreach and educational purposes. I was not very prepared given the limited time I had, but showed people the weather station we have installed outside the institute. I also demonstrated to some how a kovacs drill works, which they found very interesting. Over 1300 people attended in the space of 4 hours, which, although is not a record (I think nearer to 1500 people is the record), is a lot of people.

<h3>Amusing excerpts from the diary of second-year glaciology PhD student</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I have come to the end of the second year of my PhD this January. It's been a great year, and I have been recording a lot of it in my work diary. For nostalgia's sake, and to celebrate the calamities and bizarre situations experienced, I thought I would share some of my more humorous diary snippits from the past year.</p>

'It's been a day of procrastination. Not much work done. I think it started when my Matlab script wouldn't work - "Matrix dimensions must agree"... but they <span style="text-decoration:underline;">do</span> agree?!?!'</p>

<em>[In Svalbard]</em> 'Today we packed up the boat and sailed over to Tunabreen. We got there around midday after a rocky patch which left me bed bound, eyes tight shut and concentrating on not being sick. We got there quite early and knew we would have a lot of daylight so set off to the glacier to begin scouting sites for the strain meters. It took us ages to find a suitable site as the crevasse field stretched much further upglacier than expected. Once we found a site, we drilled a marker pole so we could find it again and fashioned a flag out of my long-johns. They looked magnificent.'</p>

<em>[In Svalbard]</em> 'Back from a big day on Kronebreen. All the cameras were still there, a fox chewed through only one of the cables, and we spotted a herd of polar bears/arctic foxes/arctic hares (yes, in that order of suspects) which turned out to be ptarmigans after thorough investigation.'</p>

<em>[In Svalbard]</em> 'We changed the SD card in camera 2 today, which I'd switched timers to take one photo every three seconds. It was very adrenaline pumping as I had to run out of the helicopter <em>[whilst the rotor blades were still spinning]</em> and change the SD card as quickly as possible. My heart was pounding and I kept thinking "Time means money. <b>BE QUICK.</b>" I ran back to the helicopter in good time to find our pilots taking a selfie. They obviously weren't as concerned.'</p>

<em>[In Svalbard]</em> 'Today has been good. Very productive. I think I have got my <em>[AG-347/847]</em> practical exercise sorted. I managed to resolve the problem with DEM importing - if I ever read this diary back looking for this info, remember that <b>Pointcatcher needs cartesian coordinates. CARTESIAN, GOD DAMMIT.</b>'</p>

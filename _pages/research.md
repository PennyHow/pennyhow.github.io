<p style="text-align:justify;">My early research in volcanology as part of an internship at Lancaster University led me to undertaking at Masters (by Research) in glacier-volcano interactions in Iceland. Following this, I moved to the University of Edinburgh to study for a PhD in glacier dynamics, partnered with the University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS). I graduated in 2018 and soon after took up a post-doctoral research position at the University of York, examining glacier change with the use of historical imagery, photogrammetry and computer vision. From 2019, I have been working at Asiaq Greenland Survey as a remote sensing specialist. We monitor a multitude of environmental processes in Greenland, such as those associated with the Greenland Ice Sheet, fjords, geology and natural hazards.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">My name is Dr. Penny How and I am a data scientist with a background in Glaciology. I graduated with a PhD from the University of Edinburgh and the University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS) in 2018, where I was examining the dynamics of tidewater glaciers in Svalbard, primarily using time-lapse cameras and photogrammetry techniques. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Within this time, I learnt to code in Python and developed an object-oriented toolbox called PyTrx for deriving measurements from terrestrial glacial imagery. I continued to develop my expertise in photogrammetry and programming through post-doctoral and specialist positions in university, governmental and commercial work settings. I now work as a data scientist, closely linked to monitoring programmes over the Greenland Ice Sheet. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">This website serves as my little corner of the internet to write about glaciology, programming, life in (and out of) research, and other things I learn along the way.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Interests:</b> big data processing, terrestrial time-lapse camera set-ups and photogrammetry analysis, glacier dynamics, remote sensing, Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications in glacial environments, glacier-volcano interactions in Iceland</p>

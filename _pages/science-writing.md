<p style="text-align:justify;">I have written articles for the <a href="https://visitgreenland.com/">Visit Greenland</a>, the Greenland tourism board about glaciers and climate change. This is a focused effort to communicate science to tourists, and provide information about scientific research and glaciology in Greenland.</p>

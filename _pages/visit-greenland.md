<p style="text-align:justify;">I have written articles for the <a href="https://visitgreenland.com/">Visit Greenland</a>, the Greenland tourism board about glaciers and climate change. This is a focused effort to communicate science to tourists, and provide information about scientific research and glaciology in Greenland.</p>

*Two satellite images from Sermeq Kujalleq (Jakobshavn) captured 10 years apart, from 1992 and 2002, documenting the disintegration of its floating glacier tongue. These satellite images are from the NASA/USGS Landsat program, which was first launched in 1972 and is one of the longest continuous satellite image records in existence.*

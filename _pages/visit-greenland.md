<p style="text-align:justify;">I was hired by <a href="https://www.space-intelligence.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Space Intelligence</a> in 2018 to write a series of articles as a guest contributor on the role of remote sensing in monitoring environmental change. This included an introduction to remote sensing for non-scientific audiences, the importance of traceability in palm oil production, and an examination of known Unilever-associated palm oil mills with deforestation. Links to the full articles are provided below:</p>

*Kangiata Nunaata Serima (KNS) glacier front positions from 1994 to 2016, showing its retreat inland over time. This information was collected from satellite imagery, where the glacier position could be identified as a satellite passed over the region. These positions were derived from multiple satellites by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Climate Change Initiative (CCI), which produce large scale datasets from satellite products. The glacier front positions shown here are just one record of many glaciers in Greenland that they documented and identified front positions for.*

*Two satellite images from Sermeq Kujalleq (Jakobshavn) captured 10 years apart, from 1992 and 2002, documenting the disintegration of its floating glacier tongue. These satellite images are from the NASA/USGS Landsat program, which was first launched in 1972 and is one of the longest continuous satellite image records in existence.*
